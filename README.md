# Raid Boss as a Service

Just a quick project to practice asyncio and other tools. 

Goals:
- Build a basic service that handles basic requests with a 'long' response time
- Fight the urge to use Flask and use Django instead
- Build out a script to action on the service and handle multiple slow requests async-ly
- Use attrs to see what it offers me on a basic level
