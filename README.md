# Raid Boss as a Service

Just a quick project to practice asyncio and other tools. 

Goals:
- Build a service that takes a some amount of requests per minute and action on a 'raid boss' based on the request
- Do not lose/miss request results when interacting with the 'boss', 5 actions that happen at the same time should be reflected on the boss correctly
- Fight the urge to use Flask, and use Django for practice
- Try out attrs
