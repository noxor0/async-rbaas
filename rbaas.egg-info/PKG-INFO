Description: # Raid Boss as a Service
        
        Just a quick project to practice asyncio and other tools. 
        
        Goals:
        - Build a basic service that handles basic requests with a 'long' response time
        - Fight the urge to use Flask and use Django instead
        - Build out a script to action on the service and handle multiple slow requests async-ly
        - Use attrs to see what it offers me on a basic level
